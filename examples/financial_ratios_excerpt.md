# Financial Ratios: A Quick Overview

Long-term investors focus on the **business**, not daily stock prices. Financial ratios help translate accounting data into signals about growth, profitability, cash generation, and financial risk.

Key ratios include:

- **Revenue Growth** – shows whether demand for the company’s products/services is expanding
- **Profit Margin** – indicates pricing power and operational efficiency
- **Free Cash Flow** – measures the actual cash a company generates
- **Debt-to-Equity** – shows financial leverage and risk
- **PEG Ratio** – combines valuation and growth to evaluate whether a stock is reasonably priced
